This is the C library for accessing the CQC backend. The packet format is specified in cqc.h. Evidently, you will need a C compiler to compile and run these files, as well as a unix socket library (winsock is not supported). 

To build and test the library, proceed as follows:

- make   	- compile the library and tests
- run_test.sh   - spin up the SimulaQron nodes and run the tests

You should first run ./run_test.sh" in order to verify the install. This will check the gates using tomography. This requires a small amount of time, so be patient :-)
