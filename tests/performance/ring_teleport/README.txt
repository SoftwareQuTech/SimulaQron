In this example Alice teleports a qubit to Bob.

Alice and Bob starts by creating a shared EPR pair. Alice creates a fresh qubit which she wants to teleport. In this case she puts it in the |+> state by performing a Hadamard operation. She performes the local teleportation operations and measures her qubits. She sends her measurement outcomes using a classical channel. Bob receives the measurement outcomes and performs corrections if needed. He finally measures his qubit in the standard basis and prints the measurement
outcome.
