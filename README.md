SimulaQron - simple quantum network simulator (4.0.0)
=====================================================

The purpose of this simulator of quantum network nodes is to allow you to develop new applications for
a future quantum internet, while we do not yet have real quantum network nodes available for testing. 

Since version 4.0, SimulaQron is compatible with [NetQASM](https://github.com/QuTech-Delft/netqasm).
See its documentation for how to use SimulaQron as a backend for running NetQASM applications.
