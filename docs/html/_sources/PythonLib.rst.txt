Using the Python library
========================

The python library provides a way to program a protocol on a network where the nodes listen to instructions through the classical-quantum combiner (CQC) interface. In the following examples the network is simulated by SimulaQron. But the same examples could be executed on a network with real quantum hardware which allows for instructions through the CQC interface, which is the aim for the 2020 quantum internet demonstrator.

We give some more detailed information below on how the classical communication between nodes in the application layer can be realized and also provide some useful commands to program a protocol using the Python library.

Explicit examples on how to program protocols using the Python library can be found in :doc:`ExamplespythonLib`:.
