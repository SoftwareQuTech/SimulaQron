SimulaQron - simple quantum network simulator
=============================================

The purpose of this simulator of quantum network nodes is to allow you to develop new applications for
a future quantum internet, while of course right now we do not yet have real quantum network nodes available for testing.

Documentation and examples are explained in the html documentation
